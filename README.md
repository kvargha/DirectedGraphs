# DirectedGraphs

This is a demonstration of my ability to implement abstract data types and algorithms on directed graphs.
Some of the algorithms implemented include: finding the amount of strongly connected components, determine if two vertices are in the same strongly connected component, depth first search, finding the distance between two verticies, determines if a graph is acyclic, and topological sort.
