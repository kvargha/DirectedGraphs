# DirectedGraphs

This is a demonstration of my ability to implement abstract data types and algorithms on directed graphs.
Some of the algorithms implemented include: 
- Finding the amount of strongly connected components 
- Determine if two vertices are in the same strongly connected component
- Depth first search
- Finding the distance between two verticies,
- Determines if a graph is acyclic
- Topological sort
